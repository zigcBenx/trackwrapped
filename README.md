# ./

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue (Official)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Recommended Browser Setup

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):
  - [Vue.js devtools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd) 
  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Chrome DevTools](http://bit.ly/object-formatters)
- Firefox:
  - [Vue.js devtools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/)
  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Firefox DevTools](https://fxdx.dev/firefox-devtools-custom-object-formatters/)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Slides ideas
- INTRO
- Athlete hero (first slide) - Name, country,
- Experience - years competing
- Nickname reveal
- Favorite discipline

- SEASON
- Season opener flashback
- Number of competitions this season
- PB
- Podiums this season
- Comparison to last year (if lifetime, show results growth over season)

- COMPETITION
- Rivals
- Nemesis
- worst competition or DQ

- LEGACY
- World Record comparison
- Wind
- Season highlights

-other: lane preference, add emojis for spirit animals/nickname, track tourist - multiple countries
Average points of all events together
Reaction time - some joke that your reaction time is so bad or so good
If someone is above 26years old: your main excuse “but i am old”
Main excuse: I didn't hear the gun because of bird...
Favorite lane, you keep getting put on lane "3"
"What if" - if there would be no wind I would run a PB,... if I count my last jump which was X I would jump A WR...

## Other ideas
- Github like graph of competitions
- World map of generated profiles
- Nicknames would be generated from discipline, how often they compete
- Examples: lazy cheetah (sprinter who rearly compeetes), consistent Gorilla for thrower with lots of competitions, legendary bizon,... some better names that that but you get the point -peple shouldn't be offended by the names, they should be funny and rememberable
