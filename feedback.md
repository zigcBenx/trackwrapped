# User feedback

Matic Ian Guček:
- Best result instead of average result at performance slide and for calculating  power level
    - because people hold back in qualifications and semi-finals
- highest level +1300 - Legendary
- Rivals and nemesis don't have correct data

Marko Pepelnak:
- share button at the end doesn't do anything - it should at least download photo?
- Suggestions to add:
    - How much left to achieve entry standard for big competitions
    - graph of progress over time
    - what times were necessary on last big competition for podium
    - world, european and national rankings info
    - If relay have better points, it shows relay instead of individual discipline

Filip Dominkovič:
- Improve fonts, more bold, more Vibe
- More striking
- Better animations

Andrej Skočir:
- more clean UX, better fonts
- better animations

Mathias Hove Johansen:
- faster progress between slides, option to skip by tapping
- skip inside one slide, since first part is only story, second one is statistics

Anej Čurin:
- Nicknames are to generic and often repeat among different athletes - make this more personalized
- Slides are slow paced
- Last slide for sharing:
    - besides average points add also best result
    - Season best for top 2-3 disciplines (e.g. for sprinters, who have multiple disciplines)
    - Best competition (European, World, Olympic)

Matevž Šuštaršič:
- To much slides, until final one for sharing or it takes a bit to long with progressing with animations
- Final slide should show PB for primary discipline or more disciplines
- Podium/vicotory rate maybe remove, since athletes will not be happy if it's low.
